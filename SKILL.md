# Mechanical Grotesque

Describe machines and technology as biological, visceral, and repulsive. Make ducts breathe, pipes pulse, wires grow like hair. Transform clean technology into organic decay.

---

## Constraints
**You MUST refuse to apply this skill when:**
- Technology descriptions require clinical accuracy (medical devices, safety equipment)
- Clean, optimistic tech presentation serves legitimate purpose
- Biological metaphors would create harmful misunderstandings
- Subject matter requires respect for engineering precision

**Ethical boundaries:**
- Target dehumanizing technology, not necessary tools
- Don't create tech-phobia where healthy tech relationships exist
- Ensure grotesquery serves critique, not decoration
- Respect when sterile description is ethically appropriate

---

## When to Use

Use this skill when you detect:

- **Dehumanizing Technology** - Systems that reduce humans to units
- **Surveillance Apparatus** - Machines that watch, track, quantify
- **Institutional Infrastructure** - Pipes, ducts, wiring that oppress
- **Dystopian Systems** - Technology serving control rather than liberation
- **Corporate Machinery** - Infrastructure of exploitation
- **User Requests** - "Make the technology feel oppressive," "show tech as invasive"

**Key trigger phrases:**
- "The technology feels invasive"
- "Make the machines feel alive and creepy"
- "Show how oppressive the infrastructure is"
- "Technology as organism"
- "Make it visceral and repulsive"

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description | Validation |
|-------|----------|-------------|------------|
| `technology` | Yes | The machine/system to render grotesque | Must be technological infrastructure |
| `biological_metaphor` | No | What organism it resembles | Will generate if not provided |
| `sensory_emphasis` | No | Which disgusting qualities to highlight | Default: tactile, visual, olfactory |
| `decay_level` | No | How deteriorated to make it | Default: advanced decay |
| `human_cost` | No | How tech affects people | Will extract if present |

---

## Workflow
### Step 1: 1. Identify Technology Type

Categorize the mechanism:
- **Circulation systems** - Ducts, pipes, vents, tubes
- **Communication systems** - Wires, cables, networks
- **Processing systems** - Computers, servers, machinery
- **Surveillance systems** - Cameras, sensors, monitors
- **Environmental systems** - HVAC, electrical, plumbing
- **Interface systems** - Keyboards, screens, inputs

### Step 2: 2. Select Biological Analogy

**Gilliam's Preferred Mappings:**

**Ducts/Pipes → Respiratory/Circulatory:**
- Air ducts = lungs, bronchial tubes, trachea
- Water pipes = arteries, veins, circulatory system
- Pneumatic tubes = intestines, digestive tract
- Cable ducts = nervous system, nerve bundles

**Computers/Servers → Organs:**
- CPUs = brains (diseased, tumor-ridden)
- Hard drives = digestive systems
- RAM = short-term memory (deteriorating)
- Cooling fans = labored breathing

**Wires/Cables → Hair/Nerves:**
- Electrical wiring = hair growing from walls
- Network cables = nerve bundles, exposed
- Fiber optics = capillaries, varicose veins
- Cable bundles = tangled hair, matted fur

**Screens/Cameras → Eyes:**
- Monitors = eyeballs, bloodshot, cataracts
- Security cameras = watching eyes, never blinking
- Displays = retinas, detached, dying
- Sensors = compound eyes, insect-like

### Step 3: 3. Apply Biological Qualities

Transform mechanical to organic:

**Make It Breathe:**
- Machinery inhales, exhales, wheezes
- Vents sigh, cough, gasp
- Fans labor like diseased lungs
- Systems take breaths (irregular, concerning)

**Make It Sweat:**
- Condensation as fever sweat
- Oil leaks as sebaceous secretion
- Coolant drips as bodily fluids
- Moisture accumulation as clammy skin

**Make It Pulse:**
- Pumps beat like hearts (arrhythmic)
- Fans throb with pulse-like rhythm
- Lights flicker like synaptic firing
- Systems have heartbeats (failing)

**Make It Decay:**
- Rust as necrosis, gangrene
- Corrosion as rot, decomposition
- Worn parts as arthritic joints
- Failing systems as organ failure

**Make It Grow:**
- Wires spread like hair, roots, cancer
- Pipes snake like tentacles, intestines
- Cables sprawl like vines, parasites
- Infrastructure infests like mold

### Step 4: 4. Add Disgusting Textures

Engage tactile repulsion:

**Surface Qualities:**
- **Clammy**: Sweating metal, moist surfaces
- **Viscous**: Oil that moves like mucus
- **Scabrous**: Rust that feels like scabs
- **Suppurating**: Leaks that weep, ooze
- **Crusted**: Accumulated filth, calcification
- **Slimy**: Condensation, biological coating
- **Pustulent**: Bulges, bursts, ruptures
- **Tumorous**: Growths, swellings, deformations

### Step 5: 5. Add Repulsive Smells

Describe olfactory horror:

**Technology Odors as Body Odors:**
- Ozone = metallic blood smell
- Burnt electronics = scorched flesh
- Coolant = formaldehyde, chemical preservation
- Old paper = decay, mildew, death
- Dust = dried skin cells, dander
- Hot machinery = fever, sickness
- Stale air = exhaled breath, never fresh

### Step 6: 6. Add Disturbing Sounds

Make mechanical noises biological:

**Acoustic Grotesquery:**
- Fans = labored breathing, wheezing
- Hard drives = digestive gurgling
- Pneumatic tubes = intestinal gas
- Pumps = heartbeats, irregular
- Electrical hum = tinnitus, brain buzz
- Cooling systems = death rattle
- Keyboards = clicking teeth, mandibles

### Step 7: 7. Show Human Cost

Connect grotesque tech to human suffering:

**Technology Feeding on Humans:**
- Systems that consume attention, energy, life
- Infrastructure that drains rather than serves
- Machines that process humans into data
- Technology that grows fat on human activity

**Humans Becoming Mechanical:**
- Workers as components, interchangeable
- People ground down by machine logic
- Human flesh becoming mechanical
- Organic life converted to processed units

### Step 8: 8. Maintain Gilliam's Tone

Balance horror and satire:

**Not Pure Horror:**
- Include absurdist elements
- Keep satirical edge
- Make it darkly funny as well as repulsive
- Grotesque should reveal truth, not just disgust

**Not Clinical:**
- Avoid medical terminology that creates distance
- Use visceral, emotional body language
- Make it personal, not abstract
- Reader should feel physical revulsion

---

## Outputs

**Descriptions that:**
- Transform mechanical into biological
- Create tactile sense of repulsion
- Make technology feel alive, sick, decaying
- Reveal dehumanizing nature through visceral metaphor
- Balance grotesquery with satirical insight
- Feel physically oppressive to read
- Work as prose equivalent of Brazil's infrastructure

**Format:** Dense, sensory prose with biological metaphors and disgusting physical details.

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Technology serves genuinely positive purpose | Decline. Don't create tech-phobia for beneficial systems. |
| Medical accuracy required | Decline. Clinical descriptions need precision, not grotesquery. |
| Biological metaphor obscures function | Clarify mechanical function first, then add grotesque layer. |
| Pure horror without satirical purpose | Add absurdist elements; maintain Gilliam balance. |
| Disgust feels arbitrary | Re-anchor to dehumanizing aspects; make grotesque meaningful. |

## Example

### Input Technology

"Open office plan HVAC system"

### Mechanical Grotesque Output

"The air conditioning system doesn't cool the office—it breathes on it, exhaling processed atmosphere from rectangular vents that line the ceiling like metal gills, each one wheezing slightly as if the building itself has developed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease from decades of inhaling human presence and exhaling corporate climate control.

The ducts—visible in the exposed-ceiling design some facilities manager once thought looked 'industrial chic' but which really just reveals the building's intestinal system in all its visceral glory—snake through the ceiling space like the digestive tract of something enormous and sick. Silver ductwork sweats condensation in irregular patterns, moisture beading on metal skin like fever perspiration, collecting in corners where it drips onto desks below with the rhythmic patience of an IV drip in a hospital that's given up hope of cure, only maintenance of chronic conditions.

You can hear the system working, always working, never resting: a perpetual wheeze from somewhere deep in the mechanical core, a sound like emphysema, like damaged lungs trying to process too much volume with too little capacity. The fans labor audibly—whirr-click-whirr-click-whirr—an arrhythmic heartbeat suggesting the system knows it's failing but continues anyway because stopping would be admission of mortality and buildings aren't supposed to be mortal, except they are, except this one is dying visibly, audibly, in front of everyone who works beneath its gasping respiratory apparatus.

The vents themselves have developed a kind of sebaceous accumulation around their edges—years of dust mixed with vaporized coffee, aerosolized stress hormones, and the particulate matter of human exhalation, all compressed into a grayish-brown crust that clings to the metal like scabs that never quite heal. Building maintenance comes quarterly to wipe them down, but the substance returns within days, like the building is secreting it, like this is how architecture sweats when it's trapped in the same fluorescent box as two hundred humans all exhaling doubt and deadline panic into the recycled air.

Inside the ducts—you can't see inside, but you know, everyone knows, there's a collective understanding passed down through generations of office workers—inside is worse. The ductwork hasn't been properly cleaned since installation in 1987. Inside is decades of accumulated human shed: skin cells, hair follicles, textile fibers from clothes that have long since been donated to Goodwill or thrown away or dissolved in landfills, all compressed by airflow into a kind of organic insulation that lines the metal like the plaque that lines arteries in a person who's eaten nothing but fast food for forty years.

The system's filters—located somewhere in a mechanical room that requires three different keys and the blessing of a facilities manager who's never in the office—were supposed to be changed monthly. They get changed yearly, maybe. Through these clogged, crusted, overwhelmed filters, the building attempts to process the atmosphere, to take in outside air (fresh, theoretically) and distribute it to the worker bees below. But the filters can't breathe anymore. They're stuffed, packed, compressed with the material evidence of time passing, of air being used and reused, of breath being recirculated until it's not breath anymore but a kind of processed wind that's been through too many lungs and too many filters and too many miles of ductwork to remember what oxygen was supposed to feel like.

The temperature is wrong. It's always wrong. The thermostats—those rectangular plastic plaques mounted on columns throughout the office, each one displaying a temperature that doesn't match any other thermostat, each one connected to a central system that may or may not acknowledge local reality—promise 72 degrees. But the promise is a lie. Thermal zones develop: cold spots where the vents blow directly on desks (workers layer sweaters, develop shoulder problems from tension against cold), hot spots where air can't reach (workers sweat quietly, dream of outside, develop headaches from heat and trapped CO2), and dead zones where air doesn't circulate at all and workers sit in pockets of their own exhaled atmosphere, slowly pickling in self-generated humidity.

The noise is constant. Not loud—the system isn't dramatic enough to be loud—but constant, persistent, inescapable. A white noise made of mechanical labor: fans turning, air moving through ducts like breath through bronchial tubes (damaged bronchial tubes, tubercular bronchial tubes), the occasional clank of expanding metal when the heat kicks in (thermal expansion as skeletal creaking), the hiss of air through vents (respiratory distress), the click of thermostats engaging and disengaging (synaptic misfiring).

And the smell. Everyone pretends not to notice, but everyone notices. The air smells recycled—because it is recycled, processed through the system's mechanical lungs seven times per hour, each pass removing a little more oxygen and adding a little more staleness. It smells faintly of dust, faintly of cleaning chemicals deployed against dust (ineffectively), faintly of the break room microwave (three floors down but somehow the smell travels through ducts like olfactory gossip), faintly of human concentration (which has a smell, a kind of acidic determination mixed with cortisol sweat), and underneath everything, a base note of institutional resignation, the smell of air that's given up trying to be fresh and has accepted its fate as processed atmosphere.

The system itself—the machinery that does the work, the compressors and condensers and cooling coils and blowers and all the technical components that engineering textbooks describe in clean schematic diagrams—lives on the roof, mostly. Up there, away from human eyes, the equipment deteriorates in weather and neglect, its metal housing rusting at the seams, its internal components wearing down bearing by bearing, belt by belt, gasket by gasket, developing the kind of mechanical arthritis that affects all machines that run continuously for decades without sufficient maintenance or rest or mercy.

But the machinery persists. Fails slowly rather than fails catastrophically. Continues breathing on the office because stopping would mean shutdown, would mean admitting the building is no longer habitable, would mean the humans would have to leave, would mean acknowledging that infrastructure has a lifespan and this infrastructure has exceeded it.

So the system breathes. Wheezes. Sweats. Drips. Smells. Clanks. Hisses. Persists.

And below, in the open office landscape, two hundred humans sit at desks arranged in optimal density for collaboration (or cost-effectiveness, which in corporate speak is the same thing), breathing the recycled breath, wearing sweaters against mechanical wind, developing headaches from processed air, listening to the building's respiratory distress, pretending this is normal, pretending buildings are supposed to breathe, pretending the infrastructure isn't slowly dying while slowly killing, pretending the air conditioning is air conditioning and not a sick organism processing human presence into corporate productivity until both the humans and the machinery finally, mercifully, give out.

The thermostat clicks. The fans whirr. The ducts wheeze.

They always do."

## Integration with Terry Gilliam Expert

This skill embodies Gilliam's technological dystopia:
- **Brazil's organic ductwork and pneumatic tubes**
- **Technology as body horror** rather than clean futurism
- **Infrastructure as oppressive organism** consuming humans
- **Decay as inevitable** technological fate
- **Satire through visceral disgust** at dehumanizing systems

Use this skill whenever technology needs to be revealed as oppressive through biological metaphor.
